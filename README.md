# About me
Hi! I'm Jack, a junior in high school. I don't know who you are or how you made it here but welcome, I guess.  
I enjoy playing video games, indoor bouldering, and programming.  
In total, I have made around 4 complete games in Unity alone, specializing in 2d, but dabbling in 3d.  
I work as a code coach at www.thecoderschool.com
