Hi! I'm Jack, a junior in high school. I don't know who you are or how you made it here but welcome, I guess.  
I enjoy playing video games, indoor bouldering, and programming.  
Right now I'm working on creating my first public game made with Unity (https://github.com/Sylvye/Cards-TD)  
In total, I have made around 4 complete games in Unity alone. All except one are 2D. I have, however, done a lot of Pygame in the past.  
I work as a code coach at www.thecoderschool.com teaching (mainly Scratch) to students of all ages.  
I have two dogs, Baxter and Stoic, a full poodle and a labradoodle, respectively.
