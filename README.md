# About me
Hi! I'm Jack, a junior in high school. I don't know who you are or how you made it here but welcome, I guess.  
I enjoy playing video games, indoor bouldering, and programming.    
In total, I have made around 4 complete games in Unity alone. All except one are 2D. I have, however, done a lot of Pygame in the past.  
I work as a code coach at [TheCoderSchool](www.thecoderschool.com)  
I have two dogs, Baxter and Stoic, a full poodle and a labradoodle, respectively.
