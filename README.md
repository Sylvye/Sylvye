Hi! I'm Jack, a junior in high school. I don't know who you are or how you made it here but welcome, I guess.
I enjoy playing video games, indoor bouldering, and programming.
Right now I'm working on hosting up a cheap minecraft server using https://github.com/doctorray117/minecraft-ondemand/tree/main.
I also do work in Unity with C#, and have made around 4 complete games. All except one are 2D.
I work as a code coach at www.thecoderschool.com teaching code, mainly in Scratch, to students of all ages.
I have two dogs, Baxter and Stoic, a full poodle and a labradoodle, respectively.
