Hi! I'm Jack, a junior in high school. I don't know who you are or how you made it here but welcome, I guess.
I enjoy playing video games, indoor bouldering, and programming.
Right now I'm working on hosting up a cheap minecraft server using https://github.com/doctorray117/minecraft-ondemand/tree/main/cdk.
I also do work in Unity with C#, and have made around 4 full games. All except one are 2D.
I work at a local business teaching code, mainly in Scratch, to students of all ages.
I have two dogs, Baxter and Stoic, a full poodle and a labradoodle, respectively.
